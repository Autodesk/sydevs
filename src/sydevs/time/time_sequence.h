/**
 * @brief A data structure which represents a sequence of increasing time points.
 *
 * @details
 * A `time_sequence` object represents a strictly increasing sequence of 
 * `time_point` objects, saving space by storing `duration`-valued offsets. The
 * offsets are expressed relative to the beginning of each partition, and each
 * partition is associated with a single `time_point` object. Adding the
 * partition and the offset yields the represented time point. Thus, from the
 * outside, a time sequence appears as a vector containing a potentially large
 * number of time points, whereas on the inside it stores time points only for
 * partitions which are generally much smaller in number.
 *
 * The `time_sequence` class can help record time series that are either
 * supplied to simulation runs or result from them. The values associated with
 * these time series are not represented, but each time value has an index that
 * can be used to look up the corresponding value in another data structure. 
 *
 * While it is possible to access the i-th `time_point` object using `ts[i]`,
 * it is preferable to use iterators when possible. In particular, when
 * accessing time points in sequence (either forwards or backwards), the
 * iterator increment and decrement operations are more efficient than `ts[i]`
 * as the latter involves a search through the partitions. To make iterators
 * more convenient and thereby encourage their use, they provide both the time
 * point and the index through the methods `first` and `second`, similar to a
 * `std::map`. In addition to the `begin()` and `end()` methods, an iterator
 * can be obtained using `lower_bound` or `upper_bound`, which search for a
 * time point using the conventions of the standard C++ algorithm of the same
 * name. 
 *
 * A current limitation of a `time_sequence` object is that it can only be
 * modified by appending time points, since inserting or removing them might
 * affect the partitions. Below is an example where a time sequence is created,
 * three time points are added, and then each index and associated time point
 * is accessed in sequence using a C++11 range-based for loop.
 *
 * ~~~
 * auto ts = time_sequence();  // ts is an empty time sequence
 * auto tp = time_point();     // tp is 0
 * ts.append(tp += 5_us);      // tp becomes 5 microseconds, which is added to ts
 * ts.append(tp += 72_fs);     // tp increases by 72 femtoseconds, and is added to ts
 * ts.append(tp += 1_hr);      // tp increases by 3600 seconds, and is added to ts
 *
 * for (const auto& entry : ts) {     // iterate through a time sequence
 *     auto i = entry.first;          // current index
 *     const auto& t = entry.second;  // current time point
 * }
 * ~~~
