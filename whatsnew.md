## 2019 April 29 -- Symmetric DEVS Presented at SpringSim 

A tutorial called *Agent-Based Modeling with Symmetric DEVS* ([Download PPTX](doc/downloads/AgentBasedSyDEVS_Tutorial.pptx)) was presented by Rhys Goldstein (Autodesk Research) at the [2019 Spring Simulation Conference](http://scs.org/springsim/) in Tucson, Arisona. The tutorial features an example of an agent-based model involving workers in a workplace. The complete code for that example can be found [here](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/tree/master/src/examples/demo/workers).

## 2019 April 26 -- SyDEVS 0.6.4 Released

SyDEVS v0.6.4 is available [here](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/releases/tag/v0.6.4).

The [building7m_advanced](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/tree/master/src/examples/research/building7m_advanced) acoustics simulation model has been improved, and a new demo example of [workers](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/tree/master/src/examples/demo/workers) in a building has been added.

## 2019 April 8 -- SyDEVS-SteerSuite Integration Presented at SimAUD

The presented paper ([Download PDF](doc/downloads/Schaumann_TowardPlatformOccSim.pdf)) describes early results of a collaboration between Rutgers University, York University, and Autodesk Research. The collaboration aims to establish a platform for simulating activities in buildings by integrating models involving different domains and paradigms. The project combines the SteerSuite crowd simulation tool with a SyDEVS model providing higher-level occupant planning and a simple heat transfer algorithm. David Schaumann (Rutgers) gave the talk at the [SimAUD 2019](http://simaud.com/2019/) symposium in Atlanta, GA.

## 2019 February 25 -- SyDEVS 0.6.3 Released

SyDEVS v0.6.3 is available [here](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/releases/tag/v0.6.3).

The [building7m_advanced](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/tree/master/src/examples/research/building7m_advanced) example now includes an acoustics simulation model.

## 2018 December 17 -- SyDEVS 0.6.2 Released

SyDEVS v0.6.2 is available [here](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/releases/tag/v0.6.2).

Several compile warnings have been resolved, and several error messages have been improved.

## 2018 December 10 -- Symmetric DEVS Presented at WinterSim

Symmetric DEVS ([Download PDF](doc/downloads/Goldstein__Symmetric_Formalism__2018-08-03_1100.pdf)), the formalism on which SyDEVS is based, was presented for the first time by Rhys Goldstein (Autodesk Research) at the [2018 Winter Simulation Conference](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/wsc2018/) in Gothenburg, Sweden. 

## 2018 November 8 -- SyDEVS 0.6.1 Released

SyDEVS v0.6.1 is available [here](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/releases/tag/v0.6.1).

A new example is included, [building7m_advanced](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/tree/master/src/examples/research/building7m_advanced), a building with multiple occupants who affect the surrounding indoor air temperature.

## 2018 September 14 -- New Website Content

There is now a [User Manual](user_manual/) that provides a detailed descriptions of the main elements of SyDEVS: atomic nodes, function nodes, composite nodes, collection nodes, and simulations.

## 2018 September 13 -- SyDEVS v0.6 Released

SyDEVS v0.6 is available [here](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/releases/tag/v0.6).

With this release, it is possible to turn any C++ type into a "qualified type" that can be passed between SyDEVS nodes. The original C++ types does not have to be modified.

Other recent features include classes to help run SyDEVS simulation in real time, and the ability to handle agents of various subtypes in a single collection node.
