## About

This library provides a framework for implementing complex systems analysis and simulation code in a modular/hierarchical fashion. The framework combines three modeling paradigms: [discrete event simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation), [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model), and [dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming). The discrete event simulation aspect is based on [DEVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEVS), a well-regarded modeling formalism involving two types of models that correspond with the library's ***atomic*** and ***composite*** nodes. The library also includes ***collection*** nodes, which extend DEVS with agent-based modeling capabilities, and ***function*** nodes, which simply compute outputs from inputs. The atomic, composite, collection, and function nodes can communicate through flow ports as part of a dataflow programming network. With the exception of function nodes, they can also communicate in a DEVS-like fashion through message ports.

In addition to supporting multiple modeling paradigms, the SyDEVS library provides comprehensive and reusable Modern C++ implementations of multidimensional arrays, Standard International (SI) units, a multiscale time representation, and other technical computing elements.

The main SyDEVS website is at [https://autodesk.github.io/sydevs](https://autodesk.github.io/sydevs).

## Main Classes

The library includes C++11/14 classes grouped into three main folders:

#### [`src/sydevs/core`](src/sydevs/core)

This folder contains generic classes that may be useful for a variety of applications.

- [`scale`](src/sydevs/core/scale.h): Represents the general concept of scale as a dimensionless power of 1000.
  - [`number_types.h`](src/sydevs/core/number_types.h) (related header file): Defines the constant `pi` and type aliases for integers and floating-point numbers.
- [`quantity`](src/sydevs/core/quantity.h): A data type template which represents a Standard International (SI) quantity (e.g. mass, distance, duration, acceleration) as a multiple of a base-1000 precision level.
  - [`units`](src/sydevs/core/units.h) (related struct template): Represents SI units including the base units such as grams, meters, and seconds, and derived units such as meters-per-second-squared.
- [`identity`](src/sydevs/core/identity.h): A data type which identifies an item by combining an encapsulated integer-valued index with a dimension supplied by a template parameter.
- [`arraynd`](src/sydevs/core/arraynd.h): A multidimensional array with features similar to those of the [NumPy Python Library](http://www.numpy.org/).
  - [`range`](src/sydevs/core/range.h) (related class): Represents a range of array indices along a single dimension.
- [`qualified_type`](src/sydevs/core/qualified_type.h): Traits for data types that can be passed among system nodes.
  - [`pointer`](src/sydevs/core/pointer.h) (related class): Points to any type of data.
  - [`string_builder`](src/sydevs/core/string_builder.h) (related class): Faciliates value-to-string conversions.
- [`timer`](src/sydevs/core/timer.h): Measures intervals of wall clock time.

#### [`src/sydevs/time`](src/sydevs/time)

The classes in this folder implement the multiscale time representation proposed by [Goldstein et al. (2017)](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/multiscale-representation-simulated-time) that supports the recording and scheduling of events over any combination of short and long time scales. The classes below use 64-bit operations where possible despite accommodating extremely disparate scales.

- [`time_point`](src/sydevs/time/time_point.h): Represents a point in time as an arbitrary-precision multiple of its shortest time precision.
- [`time_sequence`](src/sydevs/time/time_sequence.h): Represents a sequence of increasing time points.
- [`time_queue`](src/sydevs/time/time_queue.h): Supports the scheduling of future events.
- [`time_cache`](src/sydevs/time/time_cache.h): Provides durations elapsed since past events.

#### [`src/sydevs/systems`](src/sydevs/systems)

This folder contains the elements from which dataflow + message-passing networks are constructed.

- [`system_node`](src/sydevs/systems/system_node.h): A base class for all nodes.
  - [`atomic_node`](src/sydevs/systems/atomic_node.h) (derived from [`system_node`](src/sydevs/systems/system_node.h)): A base class for indivisible nodes in which simulation behavior is procedurally encoded.
  - [`composite_node`](src/sydevs/systems/composite_node.h) (derived from [`system_node`](src/sydevs/systems/system_node.h)): A base class for all nodes defined as fixed-structure compositions of different types of nodes.
  - [`collection_node`](src/sydevs/systems/collection_node.h) (derived from [`system_node`](src/sydevs/systems/system_node.h)): A base class for all nodes defined as variable-length collections of nodes of a single type.
  - [`function_node`](src/sydevs/systems/function_node.h) (derived from [`system_node`](src/sydevs/systems/system_node.h)): A base class for indivisible nodes in which function behavior is procedurally encoded.
    - [`parameter_node`](src/sydevs/systems/parameter_node.h) (derived from [`function_node`](src/sydevs/systems/function_node.h)): A function node template for supplying parameters.
    - [`statistic_node`](src/sydevs/systems/statistic_node.h) (derived from [`function_node`](src/sydevs/systems/function_node.h)): A function node template for retrieving statistics.
  - [`interactive_system`](src/sydevs/systems/interactive_system.h) (derived from [`collection_node`](src/sydevs/systems/collection_node.h)): A base class template for all interactive closed system nodes intended to be used at the highest level of a real time simulation model.  
  - [`port`](src/sydevs/systems/port.h) (related class): A base class for the four types of ports (flow input, message input, message output, flow output).
- [`simulation`](src/sydevs/systems/simulation.h): Class template for simulations performed using a top-level (port-free) system node.
  - [`real_time_simulation`](src/sydevs/systems/real_time_simulation.h) (derived from [`simulation`](src/sydevs/systems/simulation.h)): A class template for running simulations in real time.
    - [`real_time_buffer`](src/sydevs/systems/real_time_buffer.h) (related class): A data structure which suggests event wallclock times to aid in the synchronization of a simulation's execution.
  - [`discrete_event_time`](src/sydevs/systems/discrete_event_time.h) (related class): Represents progress through a simulation, encapsulating both simulated time and a counter of events within a single point in simulated time.

#### HTML

Latest published version of the HTML documentation:

- [https://autodesk.github.io/sydevs/doc/html/index.html](https://autodesk.github.io/sydevs/doc/html/index.html)

To build or update the documentation files with [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen) make sure you are in the top level directory (where the `doxygen.config` is) and execute the following command:

- `doxygen doxygen.config`
